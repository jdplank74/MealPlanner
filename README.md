MealPlanner

This project uses code first migrations 

To create the database open Nuget Package Mananger Console and use the command:

> Update-Database

There is a postman collection that can be imported to hit the api in the Postman folder

Note: When using the requests in the postman collection The UserId (UniqueId in db) of a user will not 
match in the requests what is in the database so you will need to grab the UniqueId of the User from the Users table
